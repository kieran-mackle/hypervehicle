# HyperVehicle Components

As described in the [<tt>HyperVehicle</tt> overview](overview), a component-based approach is
used to construct geometries. We classify two types of components: generic components and vehicle 
components. The former refers to components defined by operations you may already be familiar
with from a CAD context, while the latter refers to components made specifically to help define
hypersonic vehicle geometries.
